**Chat with multiple PDFs**
This is a Streamlit application that allows you to chat with multiple PDFs. 

**The application uses the following components:**

PyPDF2: To extract text from PDFs.
langchain: To split text into chunks, create embeddings, and build a vectorstore.
Hugging Face: To load a large language model (LLM).
ConversationBufferMemory: To store the conversation history.
ConversationalRetrievalChain: To combine the LLM, vectorstore, and memory.


**Usage**
To use the application, follow these steps:

1. Upload your PDFs to the "Your documents" section.
2. Click the "Process" button.
3. Ask a question about your documents.

**The application will use the LLM to answer your question based on the information in your PDFs.**
